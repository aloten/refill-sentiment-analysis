Good morning Dr Blair. Bru, our lab,  either had a run in with an animal out pillaging in the woods or just scraped his nose up on the grasses and bushes. Either way, his hose is trying to scab over and he keeps breaking it open. Its a pretty large are of his nose and right when it starts to heal, he breaks it back open. Is there any ointment or salve that I can use to make this heal? It will be nearly impossible to put a bandage on him and he licks off the ointment we have tried. Not sure what will be best or just let time heal it.  Thanks so much, Matt McMorrow309-208-4326

Very wierd I did not place order. It was in my cart but I purposely did not give my credit card number and complete the order. I did not want to order this until after I get back next week. This unfortunately will be only package arriving on our doorstep while we are away. I am confused how this was ordered without me completing the order. I am unhappy this occurred. I do not need this for two months. Guess I will now need to ask a neighbor to get package while we are away. But who had authority to use our credit card to order this?? You or our vet. I did not know either had it on record. Paula
Yes I would like to reorder the braveto for lulu

Refill - 6 months supply
Hello -- Just spoke with LaSha at 1-888-606-3336 of Covetrus Pet Pharmacy re my request for refill of Revolution for my cat.  She says it is backordered, due in early May so should be available anytime now. After some discussion about my refill request, she says she will make sure that it is filled as soon as possible & will send me an email to confirm that.  I asked her if she needed to confirm any information with me -- she said no.  We ended call. Virginia B. Johnson
